    Q. 1 What is JavaScript? <br>
    Ans :- JavaScript is event based, scripting or programming languge which allows to implement <br>
    some features on the web page, and its dynamically typed languge which means we dont need to <br>
    declair the varibale type before we declair it. and also can change the value at a runtime. <br>
</div> 

    

<div class="B">
    Q. 2 What is the use of isNaN function? <br>
    Ans :- to identify that given number is illegale or not we use isNan function/method. <br>
    if given number's value is illegale than it'll give true output, else it'll give us <br>
    false output. <br>
</div>

        
<div class="A">
    Q. 3  What is negative Infinity?
    Ans :- Negative Infinity is the value JS will return if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number. <br>
           exo :- x = -2/0 ; <br> 
                  console.log(x); <br>
                  <br>
                  output = -infinity; <br>
</div>


<div class="B">
    Q. 4 Which company developed JavaScript? <br>
    Ans :- JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript <br>
    as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator. <br>

</div>

<div class="A">
    Q. 5  What are undeclared and undefined variables? <br>
    Ans :- Undefined -> It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. <br>
                        Undefined is not a keyword. <br>
           Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword. <br>
</div>
                  
<div class="B">
    Q. 6 Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? <br>
    Ans :- The createElement() method in JavaScript can be used to create new items dynamically. <br>
    The setAttribute() method is used to set the attributes of the newly generated element. <br>
    By clicking a button, a modal box appears and collects the required information dynamically. <br>
    The collected dynamic data is displayed in the alert box and browser. <br>
    EXP :-  (Code) 
    
    <div class="button"> 
        <button id="addTask">Add task</button> 
    </div> 
    <div class="tasks"></div> 
    <script type="text/javascript"> 
  
        // Getting the parent element in which 
        // the new div will be created 
        let task = document.getElementsByClassName("tasks"); 
  
        // Getting the addTask button element 
        let addTask = document.getElementById("addTask"); 
          
        // Adding onclick event to the button 
        addTask.addEventListener('click', function () { 
      
            // Traversing through collection of HTML 
            // elements (tasks here) 
            for (let i = 0; i < task.length; i++) { 
                  
                // New div element is created   
                let newDiv = document.createElement("div"); 
                      
                // Setting the attribute of class type to newDiv  
                newDiv.setAttribute("class", "list"); 
                     
                // innerText used to write the text in newDiv  
                newDiv.innerText = "New Div created"; 
                       
                // Finally append the newDiv to the 
                // parent i.e. tasks    
                task[i].append(newDiv); 
            } 
        }) 
    </script> 
</div>

<div class="A">
    Q. 7  What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?<br>
    Ans :- Storage The Viewstate is stored within the page itself (in encrypted text), <br>
     while the Sessionstate is stored in the server. Session is used mainly for storing user  <br>
     specific data (session specific data ). <br>

</div>
<div class="B">
    Q.8  What is === operator? <br>
    Ans :- In JavaScript, === is a comparison operator that checks the equality of two values without performing <br>
     any type conversion. This means that if the values being compared have different data types, === will return false . <br>
      For example: javascript. log(7 === 7); // true console. <br>
</div>

<div class="A">
    Q. 9 How can the style/class of an element be changed? <br>

</div>

<div class="B">
    Q. 10 How to read and write a file using JavaScript? <br>

</div>

<div class="B">
    Q. 12 How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?<br>
    Ans :- Using parseInt() <br>
    It stops at the n character, and treats the preceding string as a normal integer, <br>
    with possible loss of precision. You should pass the string to the BigInt() function instead, <br>
     without the trailing n character. <br>
</div>

<div class="A">
    Q. 13 What is the function of the delete operator? <br>
    Ans:- The delete operator removes a property from an object. <br>

      the object held by that property is eventually released automatically. <br>

     usually using void(0) (which is equivalent to void 0 ). In these cases, the global variable undefined can be used. <br>
</div>

<div class="B">
    Q. 16 How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript? <br>
    Ans: - The open() method of the Window interface loads a specified resource into a new or existing browsing context <br>
     (that is, a tab, a window, or an iframe) under a specified name. <br>
     open() <br>
     open(url) <br>
     open(url,target) <br>
</div>

<div class="A">
    Q. 17 What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript? <br>
    Ans :- Please note that using innerHTML to append HTML elements (e.g. el. innerHTML += "&lt;a href='…'link&lt;/a&gt;" ) will result in <br>
     the removal of any previously set event listeners. That is, after you append any HTML element that way you won't be able to listen to the <br>
     previously set event listeners. <br>
      <br>
      It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so that's why it takes time. <br>
       When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML. <br>
</div>
